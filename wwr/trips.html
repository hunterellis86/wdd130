                        <h3>Easy Course</h3>
                        <h4>54.50 per Person</h4>
                        <h4> 36.00 12 and under</h4>
                        <p> This course is one easy ride with some great adrenaline. On average this trip lasts about 90 minutes coursing over 5 different medium size white water. This is perfect for when you have little kids or enexperinced rafters on the boat. You'll pass by several different natural sites that our instructors will point out. This ride is paid per person but discounts can be offered if you fill up an entire boat. Waivers need to be filled before check in and after reservation has been made. You can reserve spots as early as they are made open but must have  be booked 48 hours prior to rafting date. There is also a 48hr cancellation notice in effect for partial refund.</p>

                        <h3>Die Hard</h3>
                        <h4>74.80 per Person</h4>
                        <p> The die hard course lasts roughly 3 hours! This one starts the same docking station as our easy course and follows it all the way through and about 3 miles after that as well. On this course you will reach rapids that are closer to 5-7 feet tall. We do not reccomend taking inexpeirenced rafters on this course, and advice to use caution if bringing minors on the ride. Children under 12 are not allowed on this course.</p>
